            Our platform does not process payments directly. Buyers transfer
            payments to farmers using the payment method specified in the
            contract, such as bank transfer, UPI, or other agreed methods. This
            approach ensures transparency and flexibility for both parties. By
            handling payments directly, buyers and farmers have greater control
            over transactions and avoid platform fees, leading to cost-effective
            and secure dealings.

            While our platform does not provide lab tests or farmer reviews, we
            do offer a unique crop prediction feature. This allows you to

            and soil quality. This information helps you make informed decisions
            before proceeding with a contract.

            Yes, you can request changes to a contract after itâ€™s signed. Both
            parties must agree to the changes, and the contract will be updated
